Three years ago, we made the decision to migrate from a monolithic Rails application to microservices. Here's what we learned along the way.

## The Decision Matrix

Before jumping into microservices, we evaluated our specific needs:

### Why We Chose Microservices
- **Team Scale**: 50+ engineers on one codebase was causing conflicts
- **Deploy Independence**: Features were blocked by unrelated issues
- **Technology Diversity**: Different problems needed different tools
- **Scaling Patterns**: Components had vastly different resource needs

### What We Were Willing to Accept
- Increased operational complexity
- Distributed system challenges
- Higher infrastructure costs initially
- Significant migration effort

## The Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Strangler Fig Pattern

We didn't rewrite everything at once. Instead, we gradually extracted services:

```javascript
// API Gateway routes requests to appropriate service
const routes = {
  '/api/users/*': 'http://user-service:3000',
  '/api/payments/*': 'http://payment-service:3000',
  '/api/*': 'http://legacy-monolith:3000', // Everything else
};
```

### Phase 2: Data Separation

The hardest part was separating the database:

```sql
-- Before: Single database
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  amount DECIMAL,
  status VARCHAR
);

-- After: Service-specific databases
-- Orders Service DB
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER, -- No foreign key
  amount DECIMAL,
  status VARCHAR
);

-- Synchronization via events
```

### Phase 3: Event-Driven Communication

We implemented an event bus for service communication:

```javascript
// Publishing an event
await eventBus.publish('order.created', {
  orderId: order.id,
  userId: order.userId,
  amount: order.amount,
  timestamp: new Date()
});

// Subscribing to events
eventBus.subscribe('order.created', async (event) => {
  await updateUserAnalytics(event.userId, event.amount);
});
```

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Distributed Tracing

**Problem**: Lost visibility into request flow

**Solution**: Implemented OpenTelemetry
```javascript
const tracer = opentelemetry.trace.getTracer('order-service');

async function createOrder(data) {
  const span = tracer.startSpan('createOrder');
  span.setAttributes({
    'order.userId': data.userId,
    'order.amount': data.amount
  });
  
  try {
    // Order creation logic
    return order;
  } finally {
    span.end();
  }
}
```

### Challenge 2: Service Discovery

**Problem**: Managing service endpoints

**Solution**: Kubernetes services and DNS
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: user-service
  ports:
    - port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
```

### Challenge 3: Data Consistency

**Problem**: Maintaining consistency across services

**Solution**: Saga pattern for distributed transactions
```javascript
class OrderSaga {
  async execute(orderData) {
    const steps = [
      { service: 'inventory', action: 'reserve', compensate: 'release' },
      { service: 'payment', action: 'charge', compensate: 'refund' },
      { service: 'shipping', action: 'schedule', compensate: 'cancel' }
    ];
    
    const completed = [];
    
    try {
      for (const step of steps) {
        await this.executeStep(step, orderData);
        completed.push(step);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      await this.compensate(completed, orderData);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

## What Went Well

### 1. Independent Deployments
Teams can now deploy multiple times per day without coordination:
- Order service: 15 deploys/day
- User service: 8 deploys/day
- Payment service: 5 deploys/day

### 2. Technology Flexibility
Different services use different stacks:
- User service: Node.js (high concurrency)
- Analytics service: Python (data processing)
- Payment service: Java (enterprise integrations)

### 3. Fault Isolation
Service failures don't cascade:
```javascript
// Circuit breaker pattern
const circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(userService.getUser, {
  timeout: 3000,
  errorThresholdPercentage: 50,
  resetTimeout: 30000
});

const user = await circuitBreaker.fire(userId)
  .catch(error => ({ id: userId, name: 'Unknown' })); // Graceful degradation
```

## What We'd Do Differently

### 1. Start with Better Observability
We underestimated the complexity of debugging distributed systems. Should have invested in:
- Centralized logging from day one
- Distributed tracing before the first service
- Better metrics and alerting

### 2. Avoid Premature Optimization
Some services were too small:
```javascript
// This didn't need to be a service
class EmailService {
  async sendEmail(to, subject, body) {
    // 50 lines of code
  }
}
```

### 3. Invest More in Developer Tools
Local development became complex. We eventually built:
- Docker-compose setup for local services
- Service mock library
- Integration test framework

## The Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Costs
- **Infrastructure**: 40% increase in AWS bill
- **Operational**: 2 additional DevOps engineers
- **Development**: 6 months of migration effort
- **Complexity**: Longer onboarding for new engineers

### Benefits
- **Velocity**: 3x faster feature delivery
- **Reliability**: 99.99% uptime (up from 99.9%)
- **Scale**: Handle 10x traffic with targeted scaling
- **Team Satisfaction**: Engineers own their services end-to-end

## Key Takeaways

1. **Microservices aren't free**: The operational overhead is real
2. **Start with the monolith**: Until you have a real need
3. **Invest in tooling**: Make the complex manageable
4. **Define boundaries carefully**: Service boundaries should match team boundaries
5. **Embrace eventual consistency**: Not everything needs to be synchronous

## Conclusion

Microservices solved real problems for us, but they introduced new ones. The key is understanding your specific context and making informed trade-offs. 

Would we do it again? Yes, but we'd be better prepared for the journey.
